=====

* [Cosmic cortex](github.com/cosmic-cortex)

Active learning
===============

* labeling unknown data/classification
* semi supervised learning (!)
* gather data - build a model - validate - employ
    * after building and validating querying for labels
* quickly and easilly replacable pipeline steps (!)
    * this is what `modAL` was built for

modAL
=====

* uses the scikit learn API thus fully compatible
* modular and flexible
* estimator, query strategy training set can be provided and easily swapped
* new labels can be supplied for teaching and query labeling can be done easily
* custom query strategy can be tested easily (!) - modularity, no boiler plate code
* supports `keras`, `PyTorch`, performs bayesian optimization
* `OPEN SOURCE`
